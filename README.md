### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ I'm Nicolle, a coding gal who loves to build things that work like a charm! I'm a back-end programmer but learning about front-end and devOps!

ðŸŒ± I'm proficient in C# and Javascript, but I'm always learning and expanding my coding horizons. I enjoy creating fun side projects, diving into open-source, and collaborating with other developers to tackle tricky problems.

ðŸ‘€ Take a peek at my repositories and let's connect on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ni-colle/). Don't be a stranger, let's create something amazing together!

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a GM Mercy on Overwatch2 and I love Kpop ðŸŽµ
